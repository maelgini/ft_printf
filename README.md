Ahh printf, our good old friend, certainly the best debugging tool everyone can use.
You guessed it ft_printf is a project that consists in re-implementing the basic format specifiers (CspiudxX%) so that for the same purpose as Libft we can use it in almost all of our next projects.
(Tip : This is a really important project, hence mandatory in the first circle so you should take your time coding a solid one that will never fail you later.)
